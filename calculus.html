            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies continuous change, and it is essential for understanding various phenomena in science, engineering, and economics. Through my academic journey, I've gained an understanding of both differential and integral calculus. Below is an overview of the core topics I have learned in Calculus.</p>
