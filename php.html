            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey in learning PHP, I have gained practical knowledge of web development, server-side scripting, and dynamic content generation. Below is an overview of key topics I have explored in PHP and how it is applied in real-world development.</p>

            <h2>Core Topics in PHP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PHP Syntax:</strong> Learning the fundamental syntax of PHP, including variables, constants, data types, operators, and basic control structures like loops and conditionals.</li>
                <li><strong>Forms and User Input:</strong> Handling user input via HTML forms, using `$_GET` and `$_POST` methods to retrieve data, and ensuring data validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Writing reusable functions to organize and simplify code, and understanding the concepts of function parameters, return values, and variable scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> Using indexed arrays, associative arrays, and multidimensional arrays to manage and manipulate data collections effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Sessions and Cookies:</strong> Storing data across multiple pages using PHP sessions and cookies to manage user authentication and preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Reading from and writing to files, working with file streams, and managing file uploads in PHP.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Interaction (MySQL):</strong> Connecting to databases using MySQL, executing SQL queries with PHP, and handling data securely using prepared statements and parameterized queries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advanced Concepts in PHP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Learning the principles of OOP in PHP, including creating classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Namespaces and Autoloading:</strong> Organizing code using namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and using autoloading to load classes dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>PHP Frameworks:</strong> Exploring popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony for building scalable and maintainable web applications more efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> Understanding how to create and consume RESTful APIs using PHP, and handling HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> Implementing security features in PHP applications, including password hashing, preventing SQL injection, and mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Best Practices in PHP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code Organization:</strong> Structuring PHP projects with clear file organization, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and reusable components.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Using `try-catch` blocks and custom error handling to manage exceptions and maintain a smooth user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Utilizing Git for version control to manage code changes, collaborate with teams, and deploy projects effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Writing unit tests with PHPUnit, debugging code with tools like Xdebug, and using error logs for troubleshooting and performance optimization.</li>
