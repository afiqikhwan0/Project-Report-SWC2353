            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey in learning statistics, I have gained an understanding of data analysis, probability theory, and various statistical methods used to interpret and make decisions based on data. Below is an overview of the key topics I have explored.</p>

            <h2>Core Topics in Statistics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Learning about measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and how to visualize data with charts and graphs.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability Theory:</strong> Understanding the fundamentals of probability, including probability distributions, conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem.</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Performing hypothesis tests, including t-tests, chi-squared tests, and ANOVA, to assess whether observed data supports a given hypothesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation and Regression:</strong> Studying how to analyze relationships between variables using correlation coefficients and performing linear regression analysis to make predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sampling Methods:</strong> Learning about random sampling, sampling distributions, and how to estimate population parameters based on sample data.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Software:</strong> Using statistical software such as R, Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy), and SPSS for data analysis and visualization.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Advanced Topics in Statistics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multivariate Analysis:</strong> Exploring techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, and cluster analysis to analyze complex datasets with multiple variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Studying the methods used to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals, including trend analysis and forecasting models.</li>
                <li><strong>Bayesian Statistics:</strong> Delving into Bayesian inference and methods, where probability distributions are updated as new data becomes available.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Parametric Methods:</strong> Understanding statistical methods that do not assume a specific data distribution, including the use of the Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Best Practices in Statistics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Learning to preprocess raw data by removing outliers, handling missing values, and transforming variables for analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Inference:</strong> Applying statistical reasoning to make predictions and generalizations about populations based on sample data, while considering confidence intervals and margin of error.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Effectively communicating statistical findings using clear and informative visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics in Statistics:</strong> Understanding the ethical implications of data collection, analysis, and interpretation, including issues related to bias and transparency.</li>
            </ul>
